# PS40 — AI-Powered Crypto Tax Calculator

## Problem Statement

Crypto users often have transactions such as buys, sells, swaps, transfers, and income across different records. Manually identifying taxable transactions and calculating gains/losses can be difficult and error-prone.

PS40 aims to simplify this process using AI-powered transaction classification and a configurable tax calculation engine.

## Our Solution

Our application:

- Imports crypto transactions from sample data or CSV files.
- Uses AI to classify transactions as:
  - BUY
  - SELL
  - SWAP
  - TRANSFER
  - INCOME
- Calculates capital gains/losses using selectable FIFO or LIFO cost-basis methods.
- Displays a per-transaction gain/loss breakdown.
- Generates a plain-language tax summary.
- Exports the tax summary as a JSON file.
- Generates a SHA-256 fingerprint of the tax summary.
- Stores the fingerprint on Ethereum Sepolia for tamper-evident record keeping.
- Flags unexpected AI classifications for manual review.

# INNOBLOCK 2.0 · Starter Kit

**5–7 October 2026 · GCET · Teams of 2–4 · Testnets only · Organised by the GCET Blockchain Club**

Clone this repo and you have a working dApp from minute one: a smart contract, a Python backend and a web page that write to a blockchain testnet and prove records were never changed. Spend the hackathon on your idea, not on boilerplate.

This page is the summary. The full **participant handbook** is [INNOBLOCK-2.0-Handbook.pdf](INNOBLOCK-2.0-Handbook.pdf) (10 pages), and every step is covered in detail, with screenshots, in five guides in [`docs/`](docs/), each also available as a PDF. Announcements: [@gcet_blockchain](https://www.instagram.com/gcet_blockchain/) on Instagram.

## The three days

| Day | Date | What happens | Walk out with |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Day 1 · Guest lecture** | Mon 5 Oct | Guest lecture, problem statements handed out, team ideation | A chosen problem statement, a one-line idea, and everything in [Before you arrive](#before-you-arrive) done |
| **Day 2 · Build** | Tue 6 Oct | The whole day is yours to build | Contract deployed, app live, full flow tested |
| **Day 3 · Judgment day** | Wed 7 Oct | Pitches and live demos before the judges | A tight pitch, a working demo, a submitted repo |

## Before you arrive

Do this before Day 2, ideally tonight. Installs and faucet waits are the most common way teams lose their build morning.

- [ ] **Laptop**: Chrome, Brave or Edge with [MetaMask](https://metamask.io); in MetaMask, Settings → Advanced → **Show test networks** on
- [ ] **A new wallet just for the hackathon** (a "burner"). Never use one that has held real money
- [ ] **Python 3.10+** and **Git** installed (`python --version`, `git --version`)
- [ ] **Test tokens** in your wallet. For Sepolia, these work with a new wallet: [QuickNode](https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/sepolia), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia), [PoW faucet](https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de). One teammate can share with the rest
- [ ] **The starter installed**: clone this repo and run step 2 of the [Quick start](#quick-start). If `pip install` works tonight, it works tomorrow
- [ ] **Free accounts**, one per team: [GitHub](https://github.com), [Render](https://render.com), [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or [Netlify](https://netlify.com), [Neon](https://neon.tech) or [Supabase](https://supabase.com), [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com), and an AI provider if your idea uses AI

Step by step, with a 10-minute self-test: [docs/01-setup.md](docs/01-setup.md).

## Minimum to be judged

- [ ] A smart contract deployed on a **public testnet**, its address in your README and on your first slide
- [ ] At least one transaction from your app visible on the network's **block explorer**
- [ ] A web page that connects a wallet and shows each transaction's status (pending / confirmed / failed)
- [ ] A **public GitHub repo** with a README: setup steps and how to test

Extras (AI, a database, a polished UI) earn marks, but only once the minimum works.

## Ground rules

- **Testnets only.** Any public testnet is allowed. The starter supports five EVM testnets out of the box (below), and any other EVM testnet takes one config entry. Never mainnet, never real money.
- **Burner wallets only.** Make a fresh wallet for the hackathon. Never use one that has held real funds.
- **AI is allowed**, both as a coding assistant and inside your app, with any provider you like.
- **The starter is optional.** Swap any part (Hardhat or Foundry, React, a Node backend) if your team prefers. You're judged on what you build on top.
- **Every member should be able to explain their part.** Judges will ask.

## Quick start

You need Python 3.10+, Git, and a browser with MetaMask. Full walkthrough: [docs/02-build.md](docs/02-build.md).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/murthyroshan/innoblock-2.0-starter.git
cd innoblock-2.0-starter
```

**1. Deploy the contract.** [Open it in Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/murthyroshan/innoblock-2.0-starter/main/contracts/RecordRegistry.sol) (one click), compile, then in **Deploy & run** set Environment to **Browser Extension → MetaMask** and deploy on your testnet. Copy the contract address.

**2. Run the backend.**

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate            # Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env           # Mac/Linux: cp .env.example .env
# edit .env: PRIVATE_KEY, RPC_URL, CONTRACT_ADDRESS, EXPLORER_URL
python app.py                    # http://localhost:5000/health should say "ok": true
```

**3. Run the frontend.** Set `ACTIVE_NETWORK` and `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in [`frontend/config.js`](frontend/config.js), then in a second terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
python -m http.server 8000       # open http://localhost:8000
```

Connect your wallet, store a record, ask the AI, verify. Then make it yours.

```

The demo app shows the core pattern: **keep the full record off-chain, put its fingerprint (hash) on-chain**, and let anyone prove the record wasn't changed. It works for AI decisions, certificates, land records, medical reports, trade signals and more. See [docs/02-build.md](docs/02-build.md#how-the-starter-works).
